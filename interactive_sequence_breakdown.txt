Below is a deep dive into every piece of the “3D” text interactivity on your Home page—both the narrative “story” that unfolds as users spin the text, and the full mechanics of how the code drives each step. This walkthrough is organized into logical sections so future maintainers can quickly find and update any part of the behavior.

1. Initialization & Setup

    Guard against double‑initialization

if (window.__home3d_initialized) return;
window.__home3d_initialized = true;

    Ensures that if the script is evaluated more than once (e.g. via Hot Module Reload), event listeners and animation loops aren’t duplicated.

Element references

const container       = document.getElementById('title-container');
const text3d          = document.getElementById('text-3d');
const descTypewriter  = document.getElementById('desc-typewriter');
const glasses         = document.getElementById('thug-glasses');
const secretBtnContainer = document.getElementById('secret-btn-container');

    Bail out early if any of the core nodes are missing.

Initial typewriter text

    descTypewriter.innerHTML = '';
    typewriterWrite(descTypewriter, originalDesc, 20);

        Clears the description area, then types in the original sentence character‑by‑character.

2. State Variables & Constants
Variable	Purpose
currentRotX, RotY	The current X/Y rotation angles (in degrees) applied to the text.
currentZOffset	The current translateZ distance (in px).
targetRotX, RotY	The desired angles, updated on mouse move or drag.
targetZOffset	The desired Z offset based on pointer distance from center.
spinCount	Number of completed “drags” (spins). Starts at -1 so the first drag sets it to 0.
angularVelocity	Smoothed estimate of how quickly RotY is changing (used to determine “fly‑off”).
isHovered, isDragging, isTyping, flyingGlasses, themeChanged	Boolean flags controlling flow.
animationFrameId	ID of the current requestAnimationFrame; used to cancel the loop when not needed.
RETURN_SPRING_STRENGTH, SPRING_STRENGTH	Controls how “stiff” the spring is when following the target.
MOVE_THROTTLE	Milliseconds between allowed pointer‐move updates (for ~60fps).
messages array	The sequence of playful messages that appear in the typewriter as the user spins.
originalDesc	The initial block of HTML describing your skills, used to reset the typewriter.
3. The Animation Loop & Spring Physics
startAnimation() / shouldAnimate()

    startAnimation: Queues updateAnimation with requestAnimationFrame if not already running and the tab is visible.

    shouldAnimate: Returns true any time:

        The user is hovering / dragging,

        We haven’t yet returned fully to 0°/0°/0px, or

        The glasses are “flying.”

updateAnimation()

Called once per frame; it:

    Spring physics

const diffX = targetRotX - currentRotX;
const diffY = targetRotY - currentRotY;
const diffZ = targetZOffset - currentZOffset;
const strength = (isHovered||isDragging) ? SPRING_STRENGTH : RETURN_SPRING_STRENGTH;
currentRotX += diffX * strength;
currentRotY += diffY * strength;
currentZOffset += diffZ * strength;

    Moves current values fractionally toward the targets.

Angular velocity smoothing

angularVelocity = (currentRotY - lastRotY)*0.8 + angularVelocity*0.2;
lastRotY = currentRotY;

    Used later to decide if the glasses should catapult off.

Apply transforms

    text3d.style.setProperty('--rX', `${currentRotX.toFixed(2)}deg`);
    text3d.style.setProperty('--rY', `${currentRotY.toFixed(2)}deg`);
    text3d.style.setProperty('--z-offset', `${currentZOffset.toFixed(2)}px`);

    Dynamic text‑shadow / filter

        If near zero rotation, clears shadows/filters.

        Otherwise, uses your --sec accent color (converted via hexToRgb) to compute layered shadows whose offsets, blur, and opacity scale with the rotation and Z offset.

    Glasses visibility & fly‑off trigger

        Normal: once |rotY| > 90°, hide glasses (they face away).

        Once spinCount ≥ 2 and |angularVelocity| > 50, it calls flyGlassesOff(), which:

            Clones the <img> into a position: fixed element at its screen position.

            Animates it flying off along a direction tangent to the current Y‑rotation.

            Fades it out, removes the clone, then after a short delay resets and brings the original glasses back with showGlasses().

    Loop control

        If shouldAnimate() remains true, request the next frame; otherwise clear animationFrameId.

4. Pointer & Drag Handlers

    Mouse Move (onMouseMove)

        Throttled to ~60fps.

        Maps pointer X/Y within the container to targetRotY (±30°) and targetRotX (±30°).

        Computes targetZOffset proportional to distance from center (max ~20px).

    Hover Enter/Leave

        onMouseEnter sets isHovered = true then starts animation.

        onMouseLeave clears isHovered and resets targets to zero (if not dragging).

    Drag Start / Move / End

        onDragStart prevents default text selection, sets isDragging, attaches global mousemove and mouseup, adds a .grabbing CSS class to change cursor.

        onDragMove while dragging, updates targets by accumulating movementX/*Y scaled by 0.7.

        onDragEnd:

            Releases isDragging, removes listeners, and schedules a 2s delayed reset back to neutral.

            Crucially: Increments spinCount and—unless on mobile or while typing—triggers parts of the interactive story:

            spinCount++;
            if (spinCount === 15) changeTheme();
            else if (spinCount === 1) showMessage(0);
            else if (spinCount > 1 && spinCount%2===1 && spinCount/2 < messages.length) {
              showMessage(Math.floor(spinCount/2));
            }
            if (spinCount === 2) showGlasses();

5. The Interactive “Story”

As the user spins (drags) the “3D” label, spinCount drives a tongue‑in‑cheek narrative:

    spinCount = 1

        Shows message #0:

            “I see you’ve figured out how to spin that snazzy text.”

    spinCount = 2

        Calls showGlasses(): animates the “Thug Life” glasses sliding down into view over 1.6s, setting opacity:1.

    Odd spins ≥3

        On each odd spinCount (3,5,7,…), shows the next message in your messages array:

            #1: “Having fun are we?”

            #2: “I think that’s probably enough. Why not check out some of my epic projects?”

            #3: “Okay, believe it or not, you’re actually hurting the little guy.”

            #4: “Seriously?”

            #5: “Got nothing better to do?”

            #6: “…”

    spinCount = 15

        Triggers changeTheme():

            Smoothly morphs your --sec accent color from lime‑green to bright red over 2 seconds, updating the 3D background via window.setThreeDTheme(...) at key progress points.

            Adds a .red-theme class to the <body>, causing CSS overrides (glowing shadows, pulsing icons).

            Pushes a bonus message: “Red Alert! Theme unlocked!”

            Immediately shows the “secret” red button in the title area.

6. Theme Change & Secret Button
changeTheme()

    One‑time guard: if (themeChanged) return; themeChanged = true;

    Color animation:

        Interpolates RGB each frame with an ease‑in‑out cubic easing.

        Updates CSS variables --sec and --sec-rgb.

        Calls 3D background’s setThreeDTheme({ color, emission }) at three checkpoints for visual continuity.

    On completion:

        Ensures final color is #FF0000, adds .red-theme class.

        Calls showRedButton().

showRedButton() & handleRedButtonClick()

    Inserts a round “secret” button (#secret-btn) styled in deep red.

    On click:

        Overrides all cursors site‑wide with your custom jk.svg (via an inline <style id="cursor-override">).

        Deletes itself (style.display='none').

        Typewrites “get rekd” at 55 ms/char.

        After 5 s:

            Removes the cursor override.

            Clears “get rekd” with typewriterDelete, resets theme via resetTheme().

            Re‑types the original description.

            Resets spinCount = 0 and clears the red button.

7. Resetting the Theme
resetTheme()

    Animates --sec back to the default #CCFF00 over 1.5 s with an ease‑out quad easing.

    Updates the 3D background at checkpoints.

    Removes .red-theme and .theme-transition classes.

    Clears themeChanged so the red theme can later be unlocked again.

8. Cleanup & Visibility Handling

    visibilitychange listener pauses/resumes animation and pointer listeners when the tab is hidden or shown, preventing wasted CPU and “runaway” event streams.

    beforeunload listener tears down all event listeners, cancels any running frames, and resets window.__home3d_initialized, ensuring a clean slate if the page reloads.

9. CSS Notes

    CSS variables: --sec for theme accent, --sec-rgb for shadows.

    Cursors: custom open/closed hand (openhand.svg, closedhand.svg) via cursor: url(...).

    .theme-transition: globally smooths color‐property changes.

    .theme-pulse: a 1 s scale/opacity keyframe used after the red theme locks in.

    Pseudo‑elements & shadows:

        #text-3d::before provides a blurred back layer for extra depth.

        .red-theme rules intensify glows site‑wide once the theme flips.

Summary

    Pointer & drag → spring‐based 3D transform → continuous animation loop

    spinCount → triggers the story (messages, glasses, theme)

    Typewriter → dynamic deletion and writing of messages

    Theme flip at 15 spins → red theme + secret button + cursor hijack + reset after click

    Robust cleanup & visibility handling prevents memory leaks and unnecessary work.

With this breakdown, you (or any developer) should be able to trace each piece of interactivity, tweak thresholds or messages, add new spin triggers, or adjust the spring physics—all without missing any of the playful “story” details baked into the experience.
